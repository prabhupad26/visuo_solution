## Visuo Text-2-SQL application

The objective of this challenge was to build a text to SQL query system that accepts a natural language question and responds with a valid SQL query that should help in answering the question in context a database with respect to which the question has been asked.

There are two main modules developed as part of the solution:

1. **[Experiment](https://github.com/prabhupad26/visuo_solution/tree/master/experiment)**: This is a module to test and validate various prompts, LLMs, LLM configurations and visualize the results in an experiment tracking tool â€“ weights and biases (wandb.ai).
2. **[Inference](https://github.com/prabhupad26/visuo_solution/tree/master/inference)**: A FastAPI supported backend to serve the users request and prompt the LLM which is hosted locally or hosted in the cloud or any other 3rd party service.
